   @file       DacLib.h
   @brief      Set of DAC peripheral functions.
   - First configure DAC with DacCfg().
   - Set sync mode with DacSyn() if desired.
   - Output DAC value with DacWr().
   - Example:
      DacCfg(0,DAC_REF_INT,DAC_VOUT,DAC_12BIT);
      for(i1 = 0; i1<0x10000000; i1 += 0x1000000)
         DacWr(0,i1);

   @version    V0.3
   @author     ADI
   @date       November 2010
   @par Revision History:
   - V0.1, November 2010: Initial release.
   - V0.2, October 2015: Coding style cleanup - no functional changes.
   - V0.3, October 2015:   Use Standard Integer Types, prefer unsigned types, add include and C++ guards.
