/*
 * File:        smc.c
 * Purpose:     Provides routines for entering low power modes.
 *
 * Notes:	Since the wakeup mechanism for low power modes
 *              will be application specific, these routines
 *              do not include code to setup interrupts to exit
 *              from the low power modes. The desired means of
 *              low power mode exit should be configured before
 *              calling any of these functions.
 *
 *              These routines do not include protection to
 *              prevent illegal state transitions in the mode
 *              controller, and all routines that write to the
 *              PMPROT register write a value to allow all
 *              possible low power modes (it is write once, so
 *              if only the currently requested mode is enabled
 *              a different mode couldn't be enabled later on).
 *
