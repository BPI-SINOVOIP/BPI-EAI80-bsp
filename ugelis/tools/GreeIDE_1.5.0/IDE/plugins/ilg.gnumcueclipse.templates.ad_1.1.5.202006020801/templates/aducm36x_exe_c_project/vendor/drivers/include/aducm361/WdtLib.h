   @brief    Set of watchdog Timer peripheral functions.
   @version  V0.4
   @author   ADI
   @date     October 2015
   @par Revision History:
   - V0.1, May 2012: initial version.
   - V0.2, September 2012: WdtClrInt now checks if it is safe to write to T3CLRI and
            this is now a function with no inputs
   - V0.3, October 2015: Coding style cleanup - no functional changes.
   - V0.4, October 2015: Use Standard Integer Types, prefer unsigned types, add include and C++ guards.
