// Trace support is enabled by adding the TRACE macro definition.
// By default the trace messages are forwarded to the $(trace) output,
// but can be rerouted to any device or completely suppressed, by
// changing the definitions required in system/src/diag/trace_impl.c
// (currently OS_USE_TRACE_ITM, OS_USE_TRACE_SEMIHOSTING_DEBUG/_STDOUT).
